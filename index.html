        <p>
          Hi there! I'm Kim.
          I'm a software engineer who likes using technology to solve interesting problems.
          When I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me traveling, drinking copious amounts of coffee, or
          mastering the art of the pull-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 2015, where I led the Women in Computer Science Club.
          Since graduating, I've been working in a rotational Program at Apple where I've worn many hats. I've tried out various
          areas of the stack as well as user experience.
        <p>
          I'm passionate about the intersection between technology and education and I love teaching others things I've learned along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I've worked on a number of cool projects at Apple in the past two years, they're secret!
          Here are some of the projects I've done in my free time.

            <h3>30-20-10</h3>
            <p>
              After reading the <em>New York Times</em> article <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/a-way-to-get-fit-and-also-have-fun/">A Way to Get Fit and Have Fun</a>,
              I built an iOS app in <strong>Swift</strong> to implement a fun, 30-20-10 style workout that would run in the background.
              This app lets you configure the settings of your workout and provides audio cues when it's time to switch to jogging, running, sprinting, resting, cooling down, etc.
              Because the app works in the background, you can listen to whatever music you'd like during the workout.

            <h3>Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              I recently built a pixel art generator using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>, with undo and redo functionality. It was a lot of fun to see the
              power of Redux and functional programming. I plan to add a bucket-fill feature, image export capabilities, and greater user customization. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/byteme980/pixel-perfect">Github repo</a>.

            <h3>GratBot</h3>
            <p>
              A number of studies have shown that incorporating a gratitude practice into your daily routine can make you happier.
              After reading a number of articles on the subject, I decided to make a chatbot that would make it easy to do this!
              I wrote this project using <strong>NodeJS, MongoDB,</strong> and the <strong>Messenger Webhook</strong>.
              Then I deployed it to <strong>Heroku</strong> and set up a <strong>Heroku Scheduler</strong> to automatically message users
              at their deteremined notification frequency. Check out the <a href="">Github repo</a>

            <h3>Charlotte's Website</h3>
            <p>
              It's always been a goal of mine to write a children's book about Computer Science, and recently I figured, why wait?!
              After reading Julia Evans' <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/networking-zine-launch/">Networking Zine</a>, I've been inspired
              to create my own zine geared toward children about basic web development.
