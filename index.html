          Hi there, I'm Kim!
          I'm an SF-based software engineer who likes using technology to solve interesting problems.
          When I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me traveling, drinking copious amounts of coffee, or
          mastering the art of the pull-up.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 2015. I led the Women in Computer Science Club
          and organized events, dinners with recruiters, etc. to improve the community for female CS majors at Dartmouth.
          Since graduating, I've been working in a rotational Program at Apple where I've worn many different hats. I've tried out various
          areas of the stack as well as user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have strong opinions about design, enjoy writing tests more than your average engineer, and love teaching others things I learn along the way!
          You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/byteme980">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlystrauch">LinkedIn</a>.

          While I've worked on a number of cool projects at Apple in the past two years, they're secret!
          Here are some of the projects I've done in my free time.

            <h3>30-20-10</h3>
            <p>
              After reading the <em>New York Times</em> article <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/a-way-to-get-fit-and-also-have-fun/">A Way to Get Fit and Have Fun</a>,
              I built an iOS app in <strong>Swift</strong> to implement a fun, 30-20-10 style workout that would run in the background.
              This app lets you configure the settings of your workout and provides audio cues when it's time to switch to jogging, running, sprinting, resting, cooling down, etc.
              Because the app works in the background, you can listen to whatever music you'd like during the workout.
              Check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/302010jogrunsprint">Github repo</a>.

            <p>
              It's always been a goal of mine to write a children's book about Computer Science, and recently I decided, why wait?!
              I've started to write and illustrate a childen's book about basic web development. Check out my  <a href="http://bit.ly/charlotteswebsite">work in progress</a>.

            <h3>Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              I'm not going to lie, I was a huge MSPaint fan as a kid. I recently built a pixel art generator using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>, with paint, bucket-fill, and erase functionality as well as undo and redo capabilities. It was a lot of fun to see the
              power of Redux and functional programming. <a href="https://bitly.com/kspaint">Make your own</a> pixel art or check out the <a href="https://github.com/byteme980/pixel-perfect">Github repo</a>.
